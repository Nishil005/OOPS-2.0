    "Q1. Explain Class and Object with respect to Object-Oriented Programming. Give a suitable example.\n",
    "In object-oriented programming (OOP), a class is a blueprint or template for creating objects. It defines the structure, behavior, and attributes that an object of that class will have. A class serves as a template for creating multiple objects with similar characteristics. It encapsulates data and methods that define the behavior and interactions of the objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "An object, on the other hand, is an instance of a class. It is a tangible entity created using the class blueprint. Each object has its own unique state (values of attributes) and can perform actions (methods) defined by the class. Objects interact with each other by sending messages (calling methods) and can have their own individual values for the attributes defined by the class."
